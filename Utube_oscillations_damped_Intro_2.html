    <ol>
      <li>
        Measure the period of the motion for the given initial conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set different liquid levels and measure the period again. What do you 
        observe?
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the area and damping coefficient to several different values 
        (keeping <i>the liquid level</i> constant) and plot in your notebook 
        the observed period versus the mass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do the same for the liquid density, &#961;<i>.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you dare to provide an explicit formula for the dependence of 
        the period with respect to the mass and <i>L</i>?
      </li>
      <li>
        Should the total energy of the model be preserved?
      </li>
      <li>
        Why do you think the total energy of the simulation slowly increases?
      </li>
    </ol>
