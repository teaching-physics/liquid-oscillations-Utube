      Damped oscillations of a liquid in a U tube

            This is the simulation of the damped motion of a fluid in a 
            vertical U-tube with density &#961;. The motion is restricted to the 
            vertical dimension y. (We choose a coordinate system in the plane 
            with origin at the fixed equilibrium level of the fluid, which 
            depends on the amount of liquid).
          </p>

      We have assumed that the reaction of the fluid to a displacement <i>dy</i> 
      from the equilibrium point can be modeled using Newton's law for a 
      constant mass situation, ma<i> = &#931;F<sub>i</sub> </i>, where <i>F<sub>i</sub></i> 
      is the force exerted by gravity and the friction related to the tube 
      walls. Thus, applying Newton's second law, we obtain the following 
      second-order ordinary differential equation:
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      <i>m d<sup>2</sup>y / dt<sub><sup>2</sup></sub> = -2gy/L-bv<sub>y </sub></i>,
    </div>
    <p>
      where <i>y</i> is the horizontal position of the liquid end in the tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the simulation we solve numerically this equation and visualize the 
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation allows changing the different parameters that appear in 
      the equation of motion, such as the height and cross-sectional area of 
      the tube, the density of the liquid and the damping constant.
